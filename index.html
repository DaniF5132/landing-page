                <p>The Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) is the deity of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or Pastafarianism, 
                    a social movement that promotes a light-hearted view of religion.</p>

                <p>The Jolly Fish (or Pirate Fish) is a secondary logo associated with the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
                    <br>The Jolly Fish symbolises the Pastafarian affinity with pirates.</p>

                I admire the people who wish to wear religious headwear --in colander or pirate hat - 
                    in their ID photos, while putting up with the questions, smirks, or full-on discrimination 
                    of workers.</p>

                <p>You can see that as the number of pirates in the world has decreased over the past 130 years, 
                    global warming has gotten steadily worse. In fact, this makes it entirely clear that if you truly 
                    want to stop global warming, the most impactful thing to do is -- become a pirate.</p>

        <p>“It appears that a college education has been given an artificially
            high price tag in order to leave students with little money left over
            for the basic requirements of living.
            <br>Burdened by poverty, students are induced to drink cheap beer and eat past
            -in short, they are forced to act like Pirates and Pastafarians- and we can only conclude
            that this is some part of His greater plan to spread FSMism.”
